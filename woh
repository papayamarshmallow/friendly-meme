<center> <h2> What is a Network? </h2> </center>
<p> <center> Simply put, a computer network is a combination of electronics  which are bonded to each other through specific connections. The main function of these networks is to communicate and share data, information and resources. Usually, the networking is linked between two or more devices which are then programmed to suit the purpose of the project. Examples of types of computer networks include hubs, switches, routers and bridges. They are all possible connection points that can be found in successful networking systems. Further information of these devices can be found in

<center> <h2> What is a Topology? </h2> </center>
<p> <center> A topology is the organisation in which a network is programmed physically and logically. It illustrates both the structure that the devices are designed in as well as the system which the data can connect together. Keywords that may be seen when exploring this topic include ‘nodes’, ‘cables’ and ‘wires’. Each component builds up a large portion of how the interconnected structure functions. Various types of topologies are used in networking, all of which have different layout patterns. Some common examples include ring topologies, star topologies, bus topologies, and mesh topologies. More information is available in

<center> <h2> Why is it Important?</h2> </center>
<p> <center> Networking has slowly become an essential part of everyday life. Our daily use of networking has found its way into simple activities and pushed us into a technologically advanced world. Computer networking is incredibly important as it allows humans to communicate across wide distances as well as share important information quickly and easily. Networking is the basis of millions of businesses worldwide, and the alignments of all the work could become much less efficient without networks to connect everyone and the data. We rely on networking heavily for various needs from homework to office work, due to the accessibility and ease of use. If this system was taken away, millions would be affected immediately. </center> </p>
